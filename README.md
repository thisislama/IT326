## About Our Project: Predicting Car Accidents
Car accidents are a significant public health concern, resulting in injuries, fatalities, and economic losses. Accurate prediction of accident occurrence can enable timely intervention and resource allocation for prevention and mitigation. This project aims to develop a predictive model to predict car accident severity based on various attributes.

## Goal 
The dataset on car accidents is collected to enable predictive modeling of traffic incidents. The primary objective is to identify patterns and key factors contributing to car accidents, such as collision severity, weather conditions, road types, and contributing elements. By using this data, predictive models can be developed to forecast the likelihood and severity of future accidents, with the aim of improving road safety, optimizing traffic management, and informing policy decisions.
